{"name":"GEOLOC","tagline":"Geolocalization, text mining, georeference","body":"#Geolocate package for any text\r\n\r\nThis package can be used on any text that have a word that can be geolocalize,for instance the name of a city, a town and important monument or place.\r\n\r\nThe first purpose of this package is geolocalize news that previously have been not tagged on any place. In a first step the script identifies all the words that begin with capitalized letters. For instances, proper personal names \"Carlos, Laia, Joan\", as well as places: \"Barcelona, New York, Notre Dam, Eiffel Tower , etc\". The script creates a python dictionary of all the capitalizes word and in this list of word, the script checks if the word can be geolocalized.\r\n\r\n##How the script geolocalized.\r\n\r\nThe script use the wikipedia API *(Application Programming Interface)* in a first stage, each time it finds a new word that begin with capital letter it connects with Wikipedia and checks if the  word can be geolocalized. If the word has not been geolocalized the program save the word in the python dictionary with its coordinates. In this way the search for the next time its going to be more efficient because if the word is on the library we have not to connect again with the Wikipedia API \r\n\r\n###Why wikipedia and not a more traditional geolocation service? (Ex: Open maps, Google maps, Geocodes, etc...)\r\n\r\nWikipedia give us the chance to develop a personalize tools for almost any language. In this first beta version the corpus of news (text) is in catalan, but we can adapt relatively easy the package to work on any language. \r\nAlso , the Wikipedia API give us the chance to create contents of \"augmented reality\", we do not limit to the content of the corpus under analysis , we can improved and mix with new information. \r\n\r\n##Some Examples\r\n \r\n![V1](https://public.tableau.com/views/Borrador1Corpus_Fecha_Lugar/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:showTabs=y&:display_count=yes)\r\n\r\n## Authors (alphabetic order) \r\nRoderic Guigo, Jorge L Salcedo, Adrià San José, Manel Vila, Josep Zapata. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
