<a id="geolocate-package-for-any-text" class="anchor" href="#geolocate-package-for-any-text" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Geolocate package for any text</h1>

<p>This package can be used on any text that have a word that can be geolocalize,for instance the name of a city, a town and important monument or place.</p>

<p>The first purpose of this package is geolocalize news that previously have been not tagged on any place. In a first step the script identifies all the words that begin with capitalized letters. For instances, proper personal names "Carlos, Laia, Joan", as well as places: "Barcelona, New York, Notre Dam, Eiffel Tower , etc". The script creates a python dictionary of all the capitalizes word and in this list of word, the script checks if the word can be geolocalized.</p>

<p>If you are a news agency that has a huge database of news, but in the first years you never have geolocalize all your information, this script is designed for you; if you are  a journalist that have to cover any report but are not sure where are exactly the places that you must include in your text, the script automatically geolocates all the places that you include in the document,  in a similar way if you are a professor  that wants to teaches a little bit of geography to your students, this can be a good tool that helps them also to practice their writing. There are multiple uses, maybe more than we can imagine.</p>

<p>The script use the wikipedia API <em>(Application Programming Interface)</em> in a first stage, each time it finds a new word that begin with capital letter it connects with Wikipedia and checks if the  word can be geolocalized. If the word has not been geolocalized the program save the word in the python dictionary with its coordinates. In this way the search for the next time its going to be more efficient because if the word is on the library we have not to connect again with the Wikipedia API </p>

(Ex: Open maps, Google maps, Geocodes, etc...)</h3>

<p>Wikipedia give us the chance to develop a personalize tools for almost any language. In this first beta version the corpus of news (text) is in catalan, but we can adapt relatively easy the package to work on any language. 
Also , the Wikipedia API give us the chance to create contents of "augmented reality", we do not limit to the content of the corpus under analysis , we can improved and mix with new information. </p>

<p>The figure above is an example of a heat map day by day of the news activity during 2014.</p>

<p>In the previous figure we can also observe a head map, but we modify the period of change (three days of differences) to perceive better  dynamic of the news saliency on different places. </p>

<p>Finally, in the figure above we show the set of news on the territory , when you select a node immediately you see the code of the different news that are associated with that place. </p>
